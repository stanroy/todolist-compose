## Usage example

When you launch the app, you'll see an empty list where you can add your tasks. To add a task, simply click on the floating button in the bottom right corner. This will take you to a new screen where you can enter the task title. If you like, you can also add a description, but this is optional. Once you've entered the task details, save it and it will appear in the task list.

From the task list, you can perform several actions:

- To mark a task as complete, simply click on the empty checkbox next to it. To unmark a task, just click on the checkbox again.
- To edit a task, click on the pen icon and you'll be taken to a screen where you can edit the task details.
- To delete a task, click on the trash bin icon.
- If you accidentally delete a task, don't worry! You can easily restore it by clicking the "Go back" button that appears at the bottom of the screen after deleting a task.
